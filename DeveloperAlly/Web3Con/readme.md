## I love your opening slide!

You have a great sense of humor, but that first moment seems rushed and I got stressed that I missed the joke right away.
My first feedback after watching and then listening again to the first couple minutes is this:

> I know speed is important, so perhaps ramping up from slow to fast for the opening would only add a few seconds to the overall prezzo, but would 
> really emphasize that you Don't Want To Overwhelm Us.

We need some time to adjust to your speech parameters in the beginning of a video, and as an honorable teacher, you are allowed to propose rules, prerequisites, suggestions.
[In How to Speak by YouTube Winston](https://youtu.be/Unzc731iCUY?t=18) simply watching and relaxing through the first 5 minutes of this is very interesting, and contains structural elements and even a useful formula for a "preamble," all the while getting the viewer totally pumped for some lifechanging KNOWLEDGE and NOT OVERWHELMING THEM.
> he has some rules for don't text or use computer, you can make this about what tool's you'd suggest your audience use or not while listening.  Is this a "write questions in the chat" or "here's a collaborative document" or "fork this repo for slides and whatever" or "just sit back relax and let me blow your mind with this futuristic files and folder spaceship technology!"

I think he makes a strong argument for "how to start", by the end of 5:36 seconds, reveals the Empowerment Promise.
