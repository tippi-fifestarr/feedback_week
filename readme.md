# 📚 feedback week
> feedback week is an attempt to decentralize, scale and improve blockchain projects.

aiming for web 3.0? developer wingbird must leverage resources, attention, and provide results. 

## 🐟 resources
> relationships (empathy) and imagination (logic) rendered into an evolvingly human 
algorhythm, invoking prosody and integrity within the ecosystem.  

big ideas and real results.

## 👨‍🎤 results
> after ~1 week of relatively intense focus (employing principle of Deep Work) and real
attempts to get people you know (aiming for range rather than homogenesis) to interact 
with the project at various and random intervals (up to them, really), synthesize and 
collect the results into a "feedback package." after getting all necessary approvals,
forward the collection (including if possible a graph of my personal process).

all requests for feedback regarding this process and results have netted no useful feedback (perhaps indicating my methods / efforts are useless?)
