## This Is What?

Tippi's Instructional Design Program Ideation (0).
Functionally, creating this with a Web 2.0 stack is a step back to assess myself as a web 2.0 fs*fs wingbird (for my pastself, in this case) under a timed setting.  
7/29/2021 - noticed Instructional Design on Chainlink Jobs.  Watched 29 seconds of the LinkedIn course and then just started writing docs. First 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QH9TQFOhssdIbT9t9nAjSvE7RTnjmVRI45i8fapJSIU/edit?usp=sharing
then
https://docs.google.com/document/d/106UTXQZfOX-akEpSQHtABaHu3fo-8qTYBQGWgqbTXD0/edit?usp=sharing
then started this app.
The readme.md needs to come first with some clear vision: Let me (only me?) upload photos to the 1 photo feed. Display only one photo at a time.  Eventually time each action ("it took you 69 seconds to upload a photo", "congrats! you wrote that comment in only 1736 seconds", "great answer! took you long enough ;) 23 seconds to be precise ;)", etc...). 
Each "current photo" has one of three states.
1. Ask a question
2. Answer (guess!)
3. Wingbird Comment


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
