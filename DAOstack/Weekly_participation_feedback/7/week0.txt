I found the DAOStack whitepaper to be a very well thought out and comprehensive document that proposed a suite of tools for creating and managing DAOs on the blockchain using governance ruls encoded into solidity based smart contract programs. It aims to be an "operating system for DAOs" and suggests a unique system of collective descision making that involve proposal creation and submission, followed by a voting protocol they named "holographic consensus" to determmine wheter or not to execute the request in the submited proposal. The Holographic consensus mechanism postulated by DAOstack employs the principle of reputation based weighted votes to ensure higher probability of decisions being made by the most reputable members votes, and it also allows DAOs to set a threshold percentage the over all voting power required to decide a vote. The claim is that this enhances the efficiency of the DAO since all members are not required to participate in all proposals for a decision to be made on them.
I also cloned the Hackers kit repo in an attempt to deploy the code on my local server and try to get a grasp of its fucntionality but sadly I was unable to run the first command successfully. all attempts to find support outside of existing documentation has been futile.
On my first visit to this repo I was quite confused as to what the purpose of it was. but on further annoying queestioning I finally understood (or at least I think I did) what to do. 

SUGGESTIONS 
-- may be the readme.md page could be modified to give better explanation of the purpose of the repository? The file can always be relocated to another folder if the project changes or evolves.

-- I also created a Contributions.md file to be used to keep a list of contrubutors, I thought to use Pseudonyms for identifiny the contributors for now so that anyone participating can decide their level of anonimity...
