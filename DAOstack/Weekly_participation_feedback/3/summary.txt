had his metamask from before, added him to the dao when creating it. 
on the last day, sent him link
and guided him through the process of voting on 
NFTmanager, Join (WHAT DOES this do???), and Competition
(set metamask to rinkeby -> connect -> proposals -> thumbs up)
I watched, coached and cheered him on as my screen updated new plugins one after the other!
"if someones mom can use it without someones help thats perfect"
a minor victory!
