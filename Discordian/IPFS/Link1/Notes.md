## 🚀 (Intro to IPFS + Filecoin)[https://youtu.be/wmuzky88xXs?t=44] 👨‍🚀

(moment1)[https://youtu.be/wmuzky88xXs?t=51] : Awesome and simple introduction
(moment2)[https://youtu.be/wmuzky88xXs?t=62] : You waste this early impact time on reading and expanding the text of the slides.  I suggest you start with an image + imagination exercise that somehow contains elements of all 5 of your presentation goals which are:

0: (Why should we care about IPFS + Filecoin)
1: Learn about the Core Concepts of IPFS & Filecoin
2: Find out what tools exist today to help you build
3: 11 fun & cool project ideas
4: Useful links (wormholes?) to explore into
5: Focused Q & A
6: (Reminding everyone what they just learned & why it matters)

> an example of a powerful story or question is framing the theoretical question, if you were on another planet how would you use (example app)?

(mnoment3)[https://youtu.be/wmuzky88xXs?t=110] : Web2.0 -> 3.0, I think you keep this moving along, but wonder why you chose to not give examples and keep it abstract (in my experience watching this, I personally understood without examples).

> a useful link that I'd like to discuss with you related to these slides is (Vitalik Buterin: The Meaning of Decentralization)[https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274] 

The section about the core values could have examples/named references to later slides.

(moment 4)[https://youtu.be/wmuzky88xXs?t=157] : This is a very powerful section, because it explains the InterPlanetary, however your opening "what is a file system? files and folders..." lacts impact or explicit acknowledgement of audiences universal experience of file systems. The next slide explains in more detail what you mean by this, so maybe just use a line from "your computer is like a browser" and say "more on this later".  **The story of being on Mars and needing a file is way too good to bury it on a slide with no image of Mars.**  I suggest opening with that image/mental exercise and then merely calling back to that story for this slide.

(moment 5)[https://youtu.be/wmuzky88xXs?t=233] : So good.  

(moment 6: Files)[https://youtu.be/wmuzky88xXs?t=270] : Typo and using "content" too many times.  Suggest deleting "content by a their" and replacing with "a file by its"... another idea: how about "CONTENT ADRESSING: Files: The F in IPFS"? Another Idea: How about a big image of a Fingerprint? Or making that graphic on the bottom more centralized ;)
