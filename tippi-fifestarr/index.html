            portfolio homepage and functional landing page for web 2.0 and even "web 3.0 portfolio projects"! Sorry, Web 
            3.0 gets me excited, if only because by merely bootstrapping web3.js with node.js, we can jump this site right 
            up to 3.0 simply showing the "Current Block Number" or "Current Difficulty" of Ethereum (a few lines of 
            boilerplate). This design thinking challenge is from devchallenge.io. First draft was done in one day.  Now it's
            up to us to refine it (and leave the interesting "accidents"!)  Thanks to Abhay Kumar who had a recently very
            SEO friendly article that I adapted from.  Web Development is often a case of reusing "proven" code, in this charset,
            the proof is in the pudding (a fork from Mr. Abhay).
            Iterate over the weekend during break from bootcamp.  Somehow get through even if I have to back it up.
            The more time spent in, refactoring code for a web 2.0 version of this very page.  Programmatically generated
            react? It could go so far, but how much time to put in seems to be fairly 2 weeks, not one. Especially since the first
            github commit was maybe friday?<a

            Tippi Fifestarr currently inhabits in context of Chicago, 1987, and that's about it for that. He has spent
            almost 10 years outside of the country, living, loving, working, travelling, and generally doing his thing.
            Some may say he has the Woo, the magic, the 无为 but that is merely bald flattery.  More important is his 
            Universally Valuable Qualities which enable him to frequently earn MVP in ranked 5v5 PvP, as well as any 
            Agile Sprint or   status. ~10 years of sustainable world travel/work experience (not relying on Google and 
            other American habits, such as: 100% certain situations, U$Ds, outsourcing and ______) in China as Homebase 
            (~9 years) and many other countries. </p>

          <p>As a wingbird, tippi-fifestarr holds to the values of the Wingbird Manifesto</p>
          <p>0. It is not about me: This is about an as-of-yet untitled game demo by Puddles Founder Tom</p>
          <p>1. What I can easily contribute: A) Production blog B) Readme.md C) Testing D) "Victory Screen" => NFT E) Decentralized Feedback Week (see <a href="https://github.com/tippi-fifestarr/feedback_week/tree/main/DAOstack">Week 0</a>) </p>
          <p>2. Survey the situation: Current playthrough video looks really fun and frustrating, might not be a way to decentralize the playing other than slowing it way way down or changing the size scale.  No sound, but Tom is famously good at sound so it's quite exciting to imagine how he fills that space.  I did a runthrough with just vocal effects was pretty boss.</p>
          <p>3. Planned Progress: As soon as the level editor is complete, I'll be able to contribute a level. But until we get a chance to check out the code, can't interface with NFT, Feedback Week, or Readme.md.  I'll help write hilarious bubble text for wingbird powerups/collection (imagine a floating bird on the tracks as collectables, different colors and they follow your car around and maybe add jump time the more you get).</p>
          <p>4. Tip Tom button (send Tom crypto! get an NFT of your progress so far?) : Hackathon ability for "NFT bonus adaptation module"</p>
          <p>5. Min/max Mindest: Minimum influence (encourage Tom's project growth and contribute ancillary enhancements) => maximum influence (how far can we go?!)</p>

          <p>After immersing in Chainlink Lab's SmartCon Summit #1, my brains were fully filled with blocks. To celebrate 3 days of productive learning, networking, and adding value best I could, I loaded up Puddle's MacRally with the goal in mind.</p>
          <p>A game made by one of the greatest musicians of our generation, there is no sound effects or music.  Really gives us something to look forward as Tom develops it further.</p>
          <p>It's devilishly tough, which is a quality rarely found in games today. For a while, I thought the timing of the jumps and drifting was synced to some BPM.</p>
          <p>Persistence got me to one of the several finish lines, and very close to others (intrensically motivating to complete the level). As a game player, it would be rewarding to have my high score saved and to see a victory screen.</p>
          <p>One missing skill on my first few days of play was how to control the car in air to catch the tight turns (especially after that rail on the left route).</p>
          <p>I do not doubt that Tom can make this game bigger and better all by himself, but I know the power of teamwork is one key that can unlock the maximum potential of his genius</p>
          <p>For an example of how to weave story and branding into a simple Unity game, here is a link to Tennyson King's <a href="https://tennysonking.itch.io/lifeonshore">Life on Shore game</a>which unlocks a music video when you complete the single level.</p>
