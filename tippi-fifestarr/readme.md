## blockchain feedback week 1: classicly recursive tippi fifestarr
DEMO LINK: https://tippi-fifestarr.github.io/feedback_week/tippi-fifestarr/ 
spends more time preparing (documenting and clarifying) than writing clear code.
committing to next week as retrospective, data organization, and increments to 
github, resume, portfolio, landing page, symposium, feedback week

this project is an attempt to benchmark a week of feedback focused on an important cause,
by tippi fifestarr, for tippi fifestarr. 
by release of working "landing page" on friday, 
next week, tippi can update www.boober.org somehow (good practice!)

## first prototype landing page released here
html css js?
